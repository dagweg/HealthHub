# Overview

HealthHub connects patients with doctors, enabling online consultations, appointment scheduling, and access to medical records. Features include medication reminders, health monitoring, health tips and much much more.

<br>

# Technologies

This particular repository holds the backend code used to provide services to the client. It is written in `C#` and makes use of `ASP.NET`. The code segregation used for this project is `MVCS` (Model-View-Controller-Service). This will be discussed more on the [Folder Organization](#folder-organization) section. Understanding these things will help you navigate through the project with ease.

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅRequests
   > Contains REST client HTTP API tests for the completed endpoints.

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅSource
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅAttributes
      > Contains custom attributes used to validate incoming request payloads.

   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅConfig
      > Stores application configuration settings, like app settings and environment variables.

   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅControllers
      > Contains API controllers that map client requests to the appropriate services.

   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅData
      > Contains data-related code, such as the `DbContext`, which manages database connections and operations.

   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅFilters
      > Stores Action Filters that help intercept and modify requests/responses before they reach the controller or after processing.

   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅHelpers
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅDefaults
         > Contains default values and constants used across the application.

      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅExtensions
         > Stores extension methods for common functionality, such as mapping between DTOs and database models.

   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅHubs
      > Contains SignalR hubs that handle WebSocket requests. For example, hubs for chat, notifications, etc.

   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅMiddlewares
      > Contains middlewares that intercept the request/response life cycle to modify or handle data as needed.

   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅModels
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅDtos
         > Stores Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) that represent only the necessary fields for request/response payloads.

      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅEntities
         > Contains database models, such as User, Doctor, and Patient.

      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅEnums
         > Stores Enums used throughout the application.

      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅInterfaces
         > Contains interface definitions for core services like Payment and Chat.

      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅResponses
         > Stores response models, typically used as return types from controllers to ensure consistent response formats.

      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅViewModels
         > Contains view models that bind data to views. This may also be used for email templates or payment pages, as this is a backend-focused project.

   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅServices
      > This is the core of the project. It contains service classes that handle business logic, interact with the database, and enforce rules.

   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅValidation
      > Stores Fluent Validation classes for validating request payloads with fine-grained control.

   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅViews
      > Stores view templates, if needed, though this is more backend-focused, so views may be limited to things like emails or invoices.

# Configurations

### Environment Variables

Application related configurations are found in `Source/Config` folder. One such configuration is `AppConfig.cs` - which is responsible for making environment variables easily accessible throughout our codebase.

Dont Forget to add appropriate mapping from your `.env` file to this configuration class.

Example:

- Lets say you have such environment variable. Inside `.env`:

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=SOME_CONNECTION_STRING_GOES_HERE
```

- To use this `DB_CONNECTION` you should add the following to `AppConfig.cs`:

```cs
public class AppConfig(IConfiguration configuration){
  // Add it here
  public string? DatabaseConnection { get; set; } = configuration["DB_CONNECTION"];
}
```

- You can make use of this `AppConfig` from other services through **DI**.

```cs
public class SomeService(AppConfig appconfig){
  public void DoSomething(){
    var dbConn = appConfig.DatabaseConnection; // You have access here!
  }
}
```

# Payments

### Chapa Configurations

### Webhooks

1. Create a [Chapa](https://chapa.co/) account
2. Goto **Profile > Settings > Webhooks**:
3. Enter the following input fields

```bash
Webhook Url = YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
Secret Hash = YOUR_SECRET_HASH
```

4. Then enable the checkboxes for
   **Receive Webhook** and **Receive Webhook for failed Payments**.

<br>

> **Side Note**: Make sure you have configured the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in the environment variables and its the same as the one you entered above for the field **Secret Hash**. Make sure your secret hash is at least 32 characters for security reasons. You can use this free tool [here](https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/#password-generator).

### Callbacks

1. Goto your chapa dashboard and on the **Profile > Settings > Account** Settings. Enter the input fields for **Callback Url** and **Success Url**

```bash
Callback Url = API_ORIGIN/api/payments/chapa/callback
Success Url =  API_ORIGIN/api/payments/chapa/success
```

> **Side Note**: `API_ORIGIN` is configured inside the `.env` file. Make sure you set it up in the project!

If you intend to change the endpoints shown above please make sure to edit the `PaymentController.cs` to match your preferred endpoint.

# Authentication

### Auth0 Configuration

1. Head to [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) and Create an application.
2. Click on the newly created app and navigate to **Settings** tab
3. Under the basic information section copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and paste it into the `.env` file accordingly
4. Under Application URIs Section add the urls you want to allow. One such url you **must** add is `API_ORIGIN/api/auth/callback`, **API_ORIGIN** being the host url found in `env` as we've discussed before.
5. Under Cross-Origin Authentication enable **Allow Cross-Origin Authentication**
6. Navigate to **Connections** tab and enable **Username-Password-Authentication** and **google-oauth2**
